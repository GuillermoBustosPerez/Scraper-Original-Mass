In order to isolate the influence of any single factor, independent data must be used to control for variation caused by the other factors. Variation in the reduction of cores and retouched tools in eight Mousterian assemblages from west-central Italy reflects the effects of several processes and contingencies. The availability of lithic raw materials strongly affects the extent of core exploitation but not the intensity of tool retouch or reduction. Evidence for differential transport accounts for some but not all of the remaining contrasts in tool reduction. Information derived from associated faunas suggests that contrasts in the duration or stability of cave-use events as well as activity variation stand behind some of the most pronounced differences in the intensity of reduction among the lithic assemblages.},

Among modern populations, the extent to which technologies are planned depends on a varnty of factors external to and internal to the cultural system, including the distribution of raw materials and settlement mobility. While data on the European Mousterian suggest that the manufacture and maintenance of tools were planned to a limited degree, evidence of truly long-term projection of needs is sparse. Most of the extant information is insufficient to evaluate whether these facts directly implicate the capacities of Mousterian hominids or whether they reflect the operation of independent factors that rendered more complex forms of planning unnecessary or impractical. Studies of a serns of Italian Paleolithic sites employing independent data to control for the contexts of stone tool manufacture and use suggest that apparent differences in technological planning among Middle and late Upper Paleolithic populations in that region may be explicable in terms of contrasting patterns of land use.},

In the absence of refits, the final state of the abandoned piece is the only remain that archaeologists have for the study of lithic reduction. The establishment of experimentally tested indexes providing strong correlations between estimated and real reduction are needed. In our work, we propose a new procedure for estimate reduction percentage. In this proposal, data are obtained from high resolution three-dimensional (3D) scans and manual measurements are avoided. The experimental test has been realized using distally retouched tools, the less suitable tools for reduction studies. The correlation levels obtained between the measured data and the estimated data increase substantially the original published from manual measurement, reaching a r2 value of 0.81 and a correlation of 0.9. The main contribution of the proposed method is the very high correlation obtained in the volume estimation (r2=0.89 and r=0.94) using the 3D-based measurements. The 3D models of the unretouched and retouched flakes used in this work are free to use and accessible through an online repository.},

Resharpening of the edges by retouch is integral to key concepts of lithic technology and patterns of site occupation dynamics. This has led to the development of indexes that quantify retouch among artifacts, allowing comparisons according to raw material type, distance to raw material source, archaeological levels, and other factors. Several methods have been proposed for measuring the edge consumed by retouch on each artifact. These indexes are usually scaled, ranging from zero to one or from zero to 100. However, few indexes measure retouch on a nonlimited scale. Here we present a new index that combines height of retouch and length of retouched edge to obtain proxies of volume lost. Advantages and limitations of the index are experimentally explored through three patterns of retouch and then applied to two different levels of Esquilleu Cave. Results show how a two-pronged index that considers consumed edge and total of volume lost by retouch can deliver insights into resharpening strategies among Middle Paleolithic groups.},

An experimental test of Kuhn’s Index led Hiscock and Clarkson to suggest that it is an excellent estimator of flake mass loss. Our own tests, using different experimental procedures, reached much less optimistic conclusions. Here, we apply their own measurement procedures, and successfully duplicate their results. It does not follow, however, that our now-consistently high correlations have a causal connection. As GIUR values increase, they are less able to estimate the actual loss of flake mass. It appears, therefore, that incremental loss of flake mass need not be the sole driver of the GIUR value. If the correlation is an inevitable byproduct of the experiment’s design, as it now appears, then analyses based on this high correlation will be misleading. The GIUR remains, however, and excellent gauge of flake edge exhaustion.},

Using multivariate regression of 3D platform surface area and external platform angle we improve the accuracy of predictions of original flake mass. We propose a method for studying reduction intensity on retouched flakes, based on comparing predictions of the initial mass of the flake with measurements of the mass following retouching to estimate the amount of mass removed through retouching. We name this approach the Initial-/Terminal-Mass Comparison, or ITMC. Our experiments demonstrate that the capacity of the 3D platform scans to predict flake mass, and by implication the capacity of the ITMC to estimate mass loss, rivals or exceeds the capacity demonstrated for existing reduction measures.},

Tension between these two seemingly incompatible propositions creates an interpretative paradox that we have expressed with the question: “how can implements be designed for, and be efficient in, a specific use if their morphology is continuously changing?” We illustrate the interpretive difficulties arising from this question through an analysis of a classic Australian site, Capertee 3, at which we document a pattern of change in edge characteristics of retouched flakes (often called ‘scrapers’) during the reduction of each specimen. Drawing on this case study we explore the implications of this contradiction for interpretations of Palaeolithic assemblages. Our conclusion is that further studies and theorising are required to help archaeologists move beyond the naïve presumption that conventionally recognized implement types have a simple association with particular uses and that by implication those types must be designed to be efficient in the particular use to which it was constructed.},

A fast and reliable index is proposed which measures retouch in terms of the invasiveness of flake scars on the surfaces of complete stone artefacts. Unlike other measures, the index of invasiveness is well suited to the analysis of bifacially worked artefacts such as bifacial points and bifaces. Experimental tests demonstrate a strong correlation between the index and measures of reduction based on diminishing flake weight and numbers of retouch blows. Inter-observer reliability is also demonstrated through the use of a blind test. Limitations of the method are discussed, although potential techniques for surmounting problems are identified. An archaeological application of the index demonstrates the utility of the method in the context of regional assemblage variability in northern Australia.},

            This paper proposes a reduction sequence for ‘scrapers' found at Ingaladdi rockshelter, Northern Territory.

Examining changes in scraper reduction along with raw material selection and core reduction at Ingaladdi through time allows for identification of apparent major changes in land‐use and mobility throughout the Holocene.},

	abstract = {Blank size and form represent one of the main sources of variation in lithic assemblages. They reflect economic properties of blanks and factors such as efficiency and use life. These properties require reliable measures of size, namely edge length and surface area. These measures, however, are not easily captured with calipers. Most attempts to quantify these features employ estimates; however, the efficacy of these estimations for measuring critical features such as blank surface area and edge length has never been properly evaluated. In addition, these parameters are even more difficult to acquire for retouched implements as their original size and hence indication of their previous utility have been lost. It has been suggested, in controlled experimental conditions, that two platform variables, platform thickness and exterior platform angle, are crucial in determining blank size and shape meaning that knappers can control the interaction between size and efficiency by selecting specific core angles and controlling where fracture is initiated. The robustness of these models has rarely been tested and confirmed in context other than controlled experiments. In this paper, we evaluate which currently employed caliper measurement methods result in the highest accuracy of size estimations of blanks, and we evaluate how platform variables can be used to indirectly infer aspects of size on retouched artifacts. Furthermore, we investigate measures of different platform management strategies that control the shape and size of artifacts. To investigate these questions, we created an experimental lithic assemblage, we digitized images to calculate 2D surface area and edge length, which are used as a point of comparison for the caliper measurements and additional analyses. The analysis of aspects of size determinations and the utility of blanks contributes to our understanding of the technological strategies of prehistoric knappers and what economic decisions they made during process of blank production.},

We set out to determine whether a correlation could be found between tool shape and reduction stage in order to look for differences between different mobility scenarios and to test the strength of classical typological classiﬁcations based on the shape of the retouched segments of tools. Our study was conducted using materials from two culturally different sites, one dating to the Late Upper Paleolithic and the other to the Early Neolithic and our focus was on a single common tool class, endscrapers. Both sites are located in the same region, meaning that the hominins that inhabited them had the same opportunities for procuring locally abundant lithic raw materials. Geometric morphometrics and 3D-based reduction analyses were performed on the tools, and shape and reduction variables were cross-referenced in the search for any existing correlation between the two. Nomadic Late Upper Paleolithic groups exhibit a highly expedient tool management strategy, without shape maintenance, and considerable correlation was found between tool shape and reduction stage. Meanwhile, Early Neolithic groups left behind a curated assemblage, exhibiting shape maintenance and great reduction intensity. In this case, shape was found to be independent of reduction. Finally, we link these behaviors to different mobility strategies and raw-material transport costs, and consider the validity of exclusively typological approaches.},

We compare this curation measure to use-life distributions. Despite use life measured only in minutes, curation varies independently of use life in different tool distributions.

But degree of reduction depends partly upon the measures used to gauge it. Most studies involve single indices that gauge reduction in different ways or at different scales, so results are difficult to compare between studies. In this pilot study, we compare four allometric reduction measures—one each based on length, length:thickness ratio, volume, and mass, estimated by comparing observed values in discarded tools to estimated original values—for consistency when applied to an endscraper sample from the Nobles Pond Paleoindian site in Ohio, USA. Fitted to the Weibull distribution, all measures suggest attrition compared to experimental controls, but variation among them demands reconciliation. A multifactorial method that weights individual measures by their principal-component loadings suggests attritional discard at increasing rate as reduction advances. More importantly, it addresses the growing problem of reconciling the many reduction measures in use, a major concern in this expanding research area.

            El grado de reavivado de las herramientas líticas y su trayectoria morfológica entre primer uso y desecho están íntimamente relacionados con temas teóricos como la integridad tipológica, la tasa de curación y las consecuencias de la duración del periodo de ocupación. Sin embargo, el grado de reavivado también depende de las medidas empleadas para determinarlo. La mayoría de los estudios utilizan una única medida que estima la reducción de diferente manera y a diferente escala, complicando la comparación entre estudios. En este estudio piloto, comparamos el grado de consistencia de cuatros medidas alométricas—basadas respectivamente en el largo, la proporción entre largo y grosor, el volumen y la masa calculada como la diferencia entre las herramientas descartadas y una estimación de su valor original—aplicadas a una muestra de raspadores procedentes del conjunto paleoindio de Nobles Pond, Ohio, Estados Unidos. Ajustadas a la distribución Weibull, todas las medidas sugieren una tasa de desgaste considerable en comparación con los controles experimentales, pero existen variaciones entre las medidas que requieren explicación. Planteamos el uso de un método multifactorial para ponderar cada medida de reducción utilizando su peso calculado en el análisis de componentes principales. Este método sugiere que la tasa de desecho aumenta conforme avanza el proceso de reducción. De manera más importante, este método ofrece una solución al problema de cómo reconciliar las muchas medidas de reducción existentes, tarea que representa un desafío crucial en esta área de investigación creciente.},

Such allometric variation (change in proportion as a function of change in size) is useful to estimate the degree of reduction that tools experienced. Reduction itself is a measure of curation, a theoretical concept of great interest in lithic studies and Paleolithic archaeology. To determine the reduction that archaeological tools experienced, we must compare their size and proportions at ﬁrst use to the same properties at discard that we directly measure. By now many size estimates can be made from discarded tools. Some are experimentally tested but few are validated using direct ethnoarchaeological controls.

As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},

Nowhere has this topic provoked more interest and debate than in the Middle Palaeolithic of southwestern France. The region's rich archaeological record has produced numerous sites, many of which have been recently excavated and thus provide a reliable dataset for better structuring Mousterian lithic variability. Researchers working with these types of datasets frequently employ the chaîne op eratoire concept to approach lithic assemblage variability; however, the validity of such analyses has recently been questioned. Here we present results of a combined quantitative and qualitative technological analysis of a large sample of assemblages from numerous well-contextualised sites in the northeastern Aquitaine Basin. We selected clearly identifiable diagnostic elements typical of different flake production systems that can be quantified by different analysts in a replicable fashion. Our results show strong differences in assemblage composition in terms of dominant production systems as well as a smaller number of mixed assemblages that combine two or more flake production methods. When considered together, these results provide not only a means for defining lithic technocomplexes and subsequently comparing assemblages but also for investigating elements of Neanderthal material culture variability.},

	abstract = {The Variance Inﬂation Factor (VIF) and tolerance are both widely used measures of the degree of multi-collinearity of the ith independent variable with the other independent variables in a regression model. Unfortunately, several rules of thumb – most commonly the rule of 10 – associated with VIF are regarded by many practitioners as a sign of severe or serious multi-collinearity (this rule appears in both scholarly articles and advanced statistical textbooks). When VIF reaches these threshold values researchers often attempt to reduce the collinearity by eliminating one or more variables from their analysis; using Ridge Regression to analyze their data; or combining two or more independent variables into a single index. These techniques for curing problems associated with multi-collinearity can create problems more serious than those they solve. Because of this, we examine these rules of thumb and ﬁnd that threshold values of the VIF (and tolerance) need to be evaluated in the context of several other factors that inﬂuence the variance of regression coefﬁcients. Values of the VIF of 10, 20, 40, or even higher do not, by themselves, discount the results of regression analyses, call for the elimination of one or more independent variables from the analysis, suggest the use of ridge regression, or require combining of independent variable into a single index.},

	abstract = {Predicting original flake mass is a major goal of lithic analysis. Predicting original flake mass allows for re­ searchers to make estimations of remaining mass, lost mass, and other features. All these measures relate to the organization of lithic technology by past societies. The present work tests three different models to predict log of flake mass: multiple linear regression, random forest regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN). Estima­ tions of flake mass were performed using the remaining features of flakes from an experimental assemblage. This assemblage was obtained by the expansion of a previous dataset through the inclusion of bigger flakes, allowing the analysis to account for the effects of sample size and value distribution. Correlation results show a large/ strong relation between predictions and real outcome (r2 = 0.78 in the best case). Comparison of the models affords insights into variable importance for predicting flake mass. Results show that (for the present dataset) multiple linear regression still stands as the best method for predicting log of flake weight. Additionally, transformation of predicted values from the multiple linear regression and true values to the linear scale re­ inforces the linear correlation above the 0.8 threshold.},

	abstract = {Archaeologists have explored a wide range of topics regarding archaeological stone tools and their connection to past human lifeways through experimentation. Controlled experimentation systematically quantifies the empirical relationships among different flaking variables under a controlled and reproducible setting. This approach offers a platform to generate and test hypotheses about the technological decisions of past knappers from the perspective of basic flaking mechanics. Over the past decade, Harold Dibble and colleagues conducted a set of controlled flaking experiments to better understand flake variability using mechanical flaking apparatuses and standardized cores. Results of their studies underscore the dominant impact of exterior platform angle and platform depth on flake size and shape and have led to the synthesis of a flake formation model, namely the EPA-PD model. However, the results also illustrate the complexity of the flake formation process through the influence of other parameters such as core surface morphology and force application. Here we review the work of Dibble and colleagues on controlled flaking experiments by summarizing their findings to date. Our goal is to synthesize what was learned about flake variability from these controlled experiments to better understand the flake formation process. With this paper, we are including all of the data produced by these prior experiments and an explanation of the data in the Supplementary Information.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the allometry of terminal Pleistocene-early Holocene age unifacial flake tools in the northcentral Mojave Desert of California to reveal linkages between landscape knowledge, tool design, and land use. Analyses of 438 unifacial flake tools (all types) show at the population scale that Mojave Desert Paleoindians, like other post-Clovis Paleoindians across North America, possessed good knowledge of the landscape and designed flake tools for short-term purposes. This design strategy repeats in three study areas but to varying degrees: flake tools in the Fort Irwin study area were designed for shorter-term use than those from the pluvial China Lake and Lake Mojave study areas. Chert flake tools were designed for somewhat shorter-term use than those made from fine-grained volcanic stones, with obsidian flake tools designed for longevity. The regional ubiquity of knappable lithic raw materials, especially cherts, partially explains the short-term design strategy given Paleoindians’ knowledge of the landscape, including where to find knappable stones. Given that the design strategy of unifacial flake tools varies by raw material type, it provides a reminder that Great Basin Paleoindian land use models derived solely or largely from obsidian projectile points and bifacial tools may result in biased interpretations.},

This new methodology has been used to estimate ﬂake mass, based on regression of platform surface area. This manuscript presents an analysis of ‘initial to terminal mass comparison’ using an experimental sample (n = 107) and tests empirical inferences on an archaeological assemblage (n = 400) from northern Australia. The experimental and archaeological assemblages were selected to reﬂect global occurrences of scrapers, convergent scrapers, and some points; making the critique of this reduction index one of global signiﬁcance. The method cannot reasonably estimate the IM of all retouched ﬂakes with intact platforms surfaces, without regression of ﬂake subsets, reducing sample size, and greatly diminishing archaeological potential. Other reduction indices are suggested to be better suited to this task.},

Here we use digital-image-analysis techniques to investigate the intensity of reduction in single-platform cores of the Developed Oldowan of the Okote Member, Koobi Fora Formation. Data suggest that this method provides a more accurate measure of reduction intensity than previous applications of a unifacial-scraper model. Assemblages of single-platform cores excavated from extensive lateral exposures of the Okote Member provide insights into the relationship between raw-material availability and discard patterns. Variation in reduction intensity suggests that tools are not always discarded in patterns that would be predicted by the availability of raw material. Further, it appears that hominin transport decisions involved an assessment of the potential use-life of certain forms. Many aspects of Developed Oldowan technology conform to previously developed models of curated technologies.},

	abstract = {The use of 3D scanning to measure platform size is remarkably accurate and precise and has been used to estimate reduction intensity in lithic assemblages. While using 3D scans to measure lithic artefacts remains best practice in archaeology, the use of 3D scanning technology is seldom possible in real-world archaeological scenarios. Time constraints, budgetary constraints, large sample sizes, remote ﬁeldwork locations, unreliable access to electricity and unsuitable raw material types can render 3D scanning unfeasible. In such scenarios, platform size is typically estimated by multiplying calliper measurements of platform width and thickness, forming a rectangular approximation of the platform. As few platforms resemble rectangles, we ﬁnd that this method of platform measurement approximately doubles true platform size and is neither accurate nor precise. To remedy this overestimation, this paper introduces and tests the Geometric Approximations of Platforms (GAP) method, where simple 2D shapes (triangle, rhombus, trapezoid and ellipse) are employed in favour of the currently used rectangular approximations. Compared with platform width and thickness measurements, the GAP method is an equally simple and easily applied method that signiﬁcantly increases both the accuracy and precision of platform measurements, being statistically indistinguishable from 3D scanned platform area values. Moreover, we offer a means by which platform width and thickness values can be converted to be used in conjunction with those obtained from the GAP method, meaning that inter-site comparisons with previously analysed assemblages would not be hindered for those employing the GAP method.},

	abstract = {About 10 years ago, a new experimental design, based on a mechanical flaking apparatus, allowed complete control over several independent variables essential to flintknapping. This experimental setting permitted the investigation of more fundamental aspects of stone technology, including the effect of particular platform attributes, core surface morphology, and the application of force on flake size and shape. These experiments used cores made of glass that were molded to exact configurations. Here we set out to investigate whether results obtained from experiments on glass cores can be extended to other materials, in this case varieties of basalt, flint, and obsidian that were cut to the exact core configurations. We focused on the relationships between the independent variables of exterior platform angle and platform depth and dependent variables of overall size (weight or mass), volume, and linear dimensions. It was found that in almost every comparison, all four materials show similar relationships in nature and degree. What differs instead is the amount of force needed to detach a flake. In other words, given the same core morphology and platform attributes the resulting flakes will be the same, but harder materials require more force to remove the flake. These results were additionally verified on Middle Paleolithic archeological materials made mostly on Late Cretaceous flints. Our results demonstrate that experiments using glass cores are valid and can be generalized and extended to other materials.},

	abstract = {Located in the Omo-Turkana basin at the northern limit of the Koobi Fora sedimentary Formation, the Fejej region has recently proven to be a rich study area for understanding early hominin behaviour and paleoenvironmental conditions. Among the rich fossiliferous and stone artefact localities discovered so far at Fejej, the FJ-1a archeological site has yielded a faunal and lithic assemblage in primary context. The archeological level is situated within a 15 meter fluvial sequence beneath a volcanic tuff. Geochronological data from the FJ-1 sequence indicate an age of nearly 1,9 Ma for the FJ-1a artefact level. The stone industry was knapped from locally available raw materials (mainly quartz and basalt) and rocks had been carefully selected according to specific petrographical and formal criterion. Hominins mastered several distinct stone knapping methods and used more or less exhaustive reduction sequences in order to produce small flakes. The different techniques used for stone reduction are defined in this paper thanks to a series of refits of flakes onto cores. Along with the refits, an in-depth analysis of the flakes, cores and worked pebbles provides an overview of the technological capacities of hominins present at the site nearly 2 million years ago. After the Fejej FJ-1a site was abandoned the archeological materials were rapidly buried, leaving an almost undisturbed archeological level. This site appears to represent a short episode of hominin occupation.},

It must be expanded in scope and applications, in lithics beyond tools, in materials generally beyond lithics, in causes beyond narrow adaptation, and in subjects beyond hunter-gatherers. TO is applied as a set of narrative interpretive tropes. To improve its practice, TO must treat curation as a continuous variable not categorical state, assimilate the time-averaged quality of assemblages as accumulations, reconcile the synchronic behavior it explains with the diachronic accumulations it analyzes, accommodate history as well as adaptation, and transform itself from narrative device to a body of specified, predictive theory. The high quality of chapters at once catalogues the current state and highest expression of TO as interpretive craft and reveals the inherent limitations of that use.

Computational modeling is a comparatively new technology with potential to provide new insights into the dynamics of human societies, but which has been minimally applied so far in the study of archaeological formation processes. We use computational modeling as an experimental environment to examine processes that form the archaeological record of lithic assemblages. This is especially important for lithics because it is a largely extinct technology and we cannot directly observe the accumulation of lithic assemblages over time frames comparable to those represented in the archaeological record. We systematically evaluate the individual and combined effects of the length of stay at sites, raw material distribution, differences in activities performed with lithics, and movement patterns on lithic assemblages that accumulate over different time intervals. Not surprisingly, increased access to raw material decreases the frequency of retouched artifacts in assemblages, while tasks that require more lithic use produce assemblages with higher retouch frequencies. While length of stay affects the density of lithic accumulations at sites, it has little effect on assemblages composition. Mobility patterns alone have limited impact on assemblage composition. However, mobility coupled with place provisioning or individual provisioning, associated with logistical and residential mobility strategies respectively, have signiﬁcant impacts on assemblage composition consistent with prior empirical studies. Counterintuitively, the artifact palimpsests of multiple occupations that characterize most archaeological deposits may provide better information about human ecology and changing adaptations than assemblages that represent snapshots of a single or a few occupations. This work provides valuable new, quantitative insights into the information about past human social, ecological, and technological practices embedded in lithic assemblages.},

The SVM concepts presented in Chapter 3can be generalized to become applicable to regression problems. As in classification, support vector regression (SVR) is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and VC control of the margin and the number of support vectors. Although less popular than SVM, SVR has been proven to be an effective tool in real-value function estimation. As a supervised-learning approach, SVR trains using a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates. Using Vapnik’s -insensitive approach, a flexible tube of minimal radius is formed symmetrically around the estimated function, such that the absolute values of errors less than a certain threshold are ignored both above and below the estimate. In this manner, points outside the tube are penalized, but those within the tube, either above or below the function, receive no penalty. One of the main advantages of SVR is that its computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input space. Additionally, it has excellent generalization capability, with high prediction accuracy.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Speciÿcally, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to ÿt the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The unifacial scrapers from High Lodge are intensively retouched tools with regular and complex shapes that have been routinely interpreted as evidence of intentional design. The primary aim is to determine whether the different scraper types identiﬁed in the assemblage represent discrete and discontinuous implement categories made according to ﬁxed designs, or rather, points or stages along one or more reduction continuums. To achieve this, we apply a range of quantitative measures of artifact reduction to all complete single, double, convergent, and transverse scrapers from the site (n ¼ 165). Our results indicate that morphological and typological diversity in the High Lodge scraper assemblage can be parsimoniously explained as a result of both the extent to which implements were resharpened during use and subtle variability in the nature of blank forms selected for retouch. Accordingly, we critique the notion that high levels of morphological complexity in retouched Lower Palaeolithic tool types necessarily reﬂect the imposition of preconceived forms on stones.},

In this chapter, I argue that, far from confounding issues of variability, resharpening can be used as a classificatory principle because it reflects human technical choices related to repeated uses of a tool. The advantage that resharpening offers is that of a mathematically suitable study object, through the investigation of shape change along the continuum of size reduction. Building upon a rich history of research in both biology and prehistoric archaeology, I present a variant of a new method for comparing resharpening trajectories, using elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis to compare the slopes of allometric regressions. The theoretical presentation is followed by a worked example using bifacial tools from two European Middle Paleolithic sites: Pech de l’Azé I (France) and Buhlen III (Germany).},

Each scraper was examined for use-wear and was assigned to a flint type and potential geologic source(s). Our results demonstrate a selective pattern of exploitation of flint which does not originate from the local Turonian outcrops, specifically for the manufacture of Quina and demi-Quina scrapers. This suggests a thoughtful, well-planned effort, taking into consideration the flint traits and future function. This pattern repeats itself throughout time, reflecting a high degree of familiarity with the potential sources located around the cave, implying the existence of knowledge transmission mechanisms concerning the location of specific flint sources and their acquisition methods, as well as concerning exploitation preferences.},

This paper identifies transported items and “passing through” of products using studies from two short-term occupation sites. The nature of the activities testified by these “ghost” remains have direct effects on archaeological records, and are paramount when interpreting lithic assemblage variability.

	abstract = {Tabun Cave is a major point of reference for Paleolithic research because of both its long sequence of cultural deposits and its rich and variable artifact assemblages. Roughly one third of the Tabun sequence contains Lower–Middle Paleolithic assemblages referred to as Yabrudian, Acheulean, and Amudian. Together, these facies comprise the Acheulo-Yabrudian (AY) complex. Previous work on these assemblages focused on distinctions between these facies based on relative frequencies of diagnostic tool types—scrapers, blades, and bifaces—present within each. This study instead examines metrics and attribute data for one artifact class shared by all three facies, scrapers, to compare variation in artifact production and life histories. Because they are well represented, scrapers are an excellent measure of continuity and/or discontinuity in technological behavior throughout the AY, providing insight into the relationships between the individual facies. Results reveal broadly consistent scraper manufacture across all facies. Small-scale differences in blanks, cortex, and dorsal scar patterns occur among beds but with no apparent directional trends. While the general structure of scraper production and design remained relatively unchanged, the chaîne opératoire was gradually altered. These clearer temporal trends are seen in artifact life histories, first with a shift from single to multiple retouched edges, later incorporating more intensive resharpening of individual edges, accompanied by increase in blank size. Between 302 and 256 Ka, Acheulo-Yabrudian hominins showed high levels of continuity in methods of blank production yet flexibility in how long artifacts were in use and how that utility was extended.},

Stratified deposits with high densities of obsidian artifacts permit the analysis of diachronic trends in manufacture, reduction, discard, and toolstone provisioning as related to technological organization in the context of hunter-gatherer mobility and land use. Throughout much of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, the occupants of Barozh 12 employed consistent unidirectional-convergent and unidirectional Levallois and “para-Levallois” core reduction techniques. Site occupation intensity varied over time, with changing emphasis on local core reduction and tool discard. Obsidian artifact sourcing indicates predominantly local toolstone exploitation, while blanks bearing retouch were intermittently transported to Barozh 12 over distances up to {\textasciitilde} 190 linear km. As a repeatedly visited, persistent place in regional settlement systems, this site records a range of mobility strategies and differential use of diverse eco-geographic zones.

This inference implies that models of the implement classes, as stages of reduction, are not a viable depiction of the retouching technology represented in Layer 21. Instead, our reconstruction of scraper retouching demonstrated that each of Bordes’s implement types has multiple histories of retouching. Some implements received little retouch, whereas others were intensively retouched; retouch sometimes changed a specimen to such an extent that the type into which it was classified was altered, whereas other specimens remained typologically stable even though they received additional retouch. The possibility that different specimens belonging to a type had different histories is a reason that typological groups may make poor analytical units for many technological questions.},

Unfortunately, no method of measuring use lives directly from archaeological remains has been developed. However, this important quantity may be related to elementary properties of tool classes such as size and weight, properties which are themselves directly measurable. Ethnographic data on ceramic vessels, in which use life is related to such properties, is described and analyzed. Using !Kung San and Ingalik data, a similar analysis is performed for a variety of nonceramic tools and objects, although few of the stone-tool classes common to archaeological assemblages are included. There, use life is related most strongly to manufacturing cost and curation rate, an archaeological measure of which is proposed. Neither is an elementary property, but they can be estimated accurately for many tool classes. These results are noteworthy but not definitive, and they underscore the continued value of museum ethnographic collections and ethnoarchaeological research.},

This paper examines one of those measures—the reduction of blade end scrapers from early Upper Paleolithic Aurignacian and Perigordian occupations in southwestern France. Evidence of end scraper reduction is compared with faunal diversity and lithic material provenience, the former a potential catalyst of and the latter a potential reflection of mobility. A relationship between less-intense end scraper reduction, somewhat elevated percentages of distant raw materials, and reindeer-dominated fauna is noted during cold and apparently open environmental conditions. Less consistency in the extent of end scraper reduction is observed among assemblages associated with more diverse and at times less-mobile fauna. These observations argue for the importance of a fine-grained comparison of lithic and other data, the complexity of procurement strategies, and the recognition that greater or lesser reduction does not translate directly into greater or lesser mobility.

            Varias medidas líticas han sido invocadas al discutir que los recolectores humanos se movieron sobre distancias mayores o menores, o se movieron con más o menos frecuencia en comparación con otros grupos similares. Este ensayo examina una de esas medidas—la reducción de los filos en los raspadores de las ocupaciones del Paleolítico Superior en el sureste de Francia-. Se compara la evidencia de la reducción en los filos del raspador con la diversidad de fauna y la proveniencia del material; el primero, un catalizador potential y el segundo, una reflexión potential de movilidad. Se nota la relation entre la reducción de los filos de los raspadores, porcentajes elevados de materias primas distantes, y fauna dominada por los renos durante condiciones ambientales frías y, según parece, abiertas. Se observa menos consistencia en el grado de la reducción de filos de los raspadores entre ensamblajes asociados con fauna más diversa y a veces mas móvil. Estas observaciones argumentan a favor de la importancia de una comparación fina entre datos líticos y otros datos; la complejidad de estrategias de obtención, y el reconocimiento de que más o menos reducción del filo no implica directamente mayor o menor movilidad.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis paper presents the argument that common interpretations of “reduction intensity” in fact conflate two different and at times independent processes. Reduction intensity should be restricted to an analysis of technological stages of raw material reduction and blank production, an overall process commonly referred to as the reduction sequence. Retouch intensity, by contrast, reflects changes to finished blanks and technological remnants arising from and related to function and use. The importance of the distinction lies in the identification of separate processes that may reveal elements of mobility, settlement pattern, and social intensification among prehistoric populations. This paper proposes that intensity should be analyzed in a reduction/retouch matrix and presents examples of such analyses.INTRODUCTIONThe “reduction thesis” (Shott 2005) has become the most powerful framework for understanding the most durable material element of the prehistoric archaeological record. The framework has emerged from analysis of varied cultural and temporal contexts by numerous researchers. This research, however, shares a common recognition of lithic reduction as a process of continual material removal that may profoundly affect the shape and size of any stone artifact.Similarly to other papers in this volume (Andrefsky; Quinn et al.; Wilson and Andrefsky), this paper will argue that the common assessment of what is termed “reduction” intensity most frequently evaluates only one aspect of those effects: retouch or more generally utilization intensity, that is, changes arising from and related to function and use.},

In lithic artifacts, use-life can be expressed as the extraction of utility, or work potential, from existing stone volume. Using experimental data and generalized linear modeling, this study develops models of artifact use-life on cores in the form of reduction intensity. We then apply these models to two archaeological case studies to (a) reconstruct the reduction intensities of archaeological cores and (b) investigate the survivorship curves of these archaeological cores across the reduction continuum using the Weibull function. Results indicate variation in core reduction and maintenance with respect to raw material properties and place use history and implicate evolutionary differences between Early Stone Age hominins and Holocene modern humans.},

Use life is to assemblage formation as lifespan is to demography, and demographers know that a population's mean lifespan is no more important than the distribution of values around that mean. When considered at all, use life typically is expressed as a mean value. But use-life's distribution—variation around the mean—affects assemblage composition independently of the mean. Distribution is neglected because its effects are not appreciated and seem difficult to measure. To improve understanding of assemblage formation, we study use-life distribution in New Guinea Wola ethnographic artifacts, using cumulative survivorship and the two-parameter Weibull model. Then we propose estimates of use-life distribution in Paleoindian stone tools. Knowing use-life distribution as well as mean, we know better how assemblages formed and improve our understanding of the archaeological record.

            Resumen
            Los conjuntos arqueológicos constan de proporciones de artefactos por categoría. La vida útil influye en la formación y, por lo tanto, el tamaño y composición de los conjuntos. La vida útil se relaciona con la formación de conjuntos como la duración de vida se relaciona con la demografía, y los demógrafos saben que el tiempo promedio de vida no es más importante que la distribución de valores respecto a la media. Cuando se consideran, típicamente la vida útil se expresan como un valor promedio. Pero la distribución B variación de la vida util respecto a la media B afecta la composición de los conjuntos en forma independiente de la media. Los arqueólogos no prestan atención a la distribución, tal vez porque sus afectos no se aprecian y son difíciles de medir. Para lograr un mejor entendimiento de la formación de conjuntos arqueológicos, en este artículo se estudia la distribución de la vida útil calculada para categorías de artefactos o herramientas etnográficas Wola, de Nueva Guinea, con base en un modelo de supervivencia acumulativa y el modelo Weibull con dos parámetros. Además, se presentan cálculos de la distribución de la vida útil de especimenes arqueológicos paleoindios. Al conocer la distribución de la vida útil al igual que la media, se logra una mejor idea de cómo seforman los conjuntos y mejoramos nuestro entendimiento del registro arqueológico.},

The result is discarded artifacts whose sizes and shapes are plain to see and easy to measure. If we can infer their original size, we also can determine tools' degree of reduction from ﬁrst use to that discard. The difference between original and discarded size reﬂects curation, which itself subsumes the concept and practice of recycling. Endscrapers are a common retouched-tool type both in North American Paleoindian and Old World Paleolithic assemblages. In this pilot study, we estimate degree of reduction in a sample of unifacial endscrapers from the Nobles Pond Paleoindian site in Ohio, USA. Also, we demonstrate how resulting curation measures can be ﬁtted to the Weibull and other statistical models, not for the sake of mere mathematical virtuosity but to compare curation rate and implicate different failure processes between data sets. Compared to an experimental known, failure in Nobles Pond endscrapers is characterized by attrition, thus ﬁts a Weibull model whose shape parameter b {\textgreater} 1. This result is useful for comparison between assemblages and for modeling how the record formed. The better we can estimate original size of discarded retouched tools, the better we can gauge curation and exploit the value of this theoretical concept.},

I fit distributions of North American Paleoindian tools to mathematical models, both for ­efficient description and to identify processes that govern discard. Reduction ­analysis is the thoughtful use of surprisingly simple measurements and practices to reveal both dimensions of past behavior and how the archaeological record formed.},

	abstract = {New methodological approaches focused on studying the reduction and use-life of stone tools have emerged in recent years, enabling researchers to move beyond strict technical and technological characterizations and explore specific aspects of occupation dynamics and economic management of resources. Previous studies have shown the importance of reduction distributions of individual measurements rather than averaged values. In this sense, survival analysis, and more specifically Weibull distributions, are one of the main inferential tools used in reduction studies. However, the resolution of Weibull distribution obtained from different methods has not been tested experimentally. In this paper, we present an evaluation of some of the main methods used in the study of core reduction intensity, such as the Volumetric Reconstruction Method, the Scar Density Index, and the non-cortical surface percentage. Our results show 1) strong and positive correlations between these approaches and actual reduction intensity, 2) similar Weibull distributions for non-cortical surface percentage, Volumetric Reconstruction Method, and logarithmic transformation of Scar Density Index. In addition, 3) the results from each method show a similar intra-assemblage variation, with a high percentage of agreement between them.
As a result, all the evaluated proposals are useful and reliable methods for estimating the degree of reduction. Finally, a workflow is proposed for approaching reduction in archaeological assemblages by integrating different methods in the same study.},
